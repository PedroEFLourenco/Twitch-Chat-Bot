# Twitch-Chat-Bot

## Pre-requisites

To run this application node.js and npm are required to be installed.

## Setup

On **config.json** configure general application settings: 
- twitch settings

This application uses Twitch's [Oauth Authorization Code Flow](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/getting-tokens-oauth/#oauth-authorization-code-flow).
The application will do the process of fetching the OAuth token for you, but you still need to provide several values like: client_id, client_secret and authorization_code.


```
{
    "twitch": {
        "token_endpoint": "https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token",
        "username": "<chatBotUsername>",
        "client_id":"<clientID>",
        "client_secret":"<clientSecret>",
        "authorization_code":"<AuthCode>",
        "channel": "<channel_to_connect_to>"
    }
}
```

## Run the application

To run the application, use the command ```npm start``` from the root of the project.
